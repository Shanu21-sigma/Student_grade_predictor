# ðŸ“˜ Student Habit Analysis â€“ Continuous Data

This data science project explores how student habitsâ€”such as study hours, sleep patterns, and screen timeâ€”affect academic performance. It uses continuous data to uncover correlations and trends that may help improve learning outcomes.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Analyze student habits using real-world continuous data
- Visualize patterns using graphs and plots
- Derive insights that may support educational strategies

## ðŸ“‚ File Included

- `student_habit_continousData.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations to show relationships (e.g., study time vs performance)  
- Insightful conclusions for education-related improvements

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Download the notebook or clone the repository  
2. Open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
3. Run each cell in order to see the results and charts
